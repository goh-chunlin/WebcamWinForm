A simple Windows Forms (.NET 5) application to demonstrate how to record video and audio via a Logitech webcam using C#.

## Objective
In 2017, inspired by ["How to use a web cam in C# with .NET Framework 4.0 and Microsoft Expression Encoder 4", a project on Code Project by Italian software developer Massimo Conti](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/202464/How-to-use-a-WebCam-in-C-with-the-NET-Framework), I built a simple demo to show how we can connect C# Windows Form with a webcam to record both video and audio.

In 2020, .NET 5 is officially announced by Microsoft. Many libraries that I used earlier are no longer working. Hence, I took the chance to upgraded this project to use .NET 5 together with other new libraries.

The recorded media will be saved as a MP4 file locally. The file will also be uploaded to [Microsoft Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/) at the same time in a container named "webcam-videos", hence the user interface asks for the connection string to the Azure Storage.

The webcam that I have tested with is [Logitech HD Webcam C270](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c270-hd-webcam.960-000694.html).
